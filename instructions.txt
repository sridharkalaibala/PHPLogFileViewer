Coalition Technologies PHP Skills Assessment

Create a configuration repository which can be used to hold an application's config variables.
The class is already created with the required methods in the src directory.  Build each method
and run vendor/bin/phpunit from the command line to test your work.

Requirements:
Configuration values must be able to be optionally set through the constructor when the class
is instantiated.

Configuration values must be accessible through array access

An unlimited number of configuration values should be able to be set

The set and remove methods must be chainable

Further instructions are in the comments for each method.  If you have any questions view the
test class.  Do not make any changes to the test class, this will result in automatic disqualification.
